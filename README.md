# AirportSimulation_KNS

This simulation was developed to be representative of a small airport containing three runways. Essentially this program operates as an air traffic controller, utilizing priority queues to determine where and in what order to assign planes to the available runways. The program updates approximately every 2.5 seconds and continues for 2.5 minutes of real time. At each timestep, there is a 20 percent chance of a flight being created. If a flight is created, it will be assigned a random distance from the airport, and a constant speed of approach, where it will update itself every timestep as it gets closer to the airport. Additionally, there is a slight chance that the flight will develop an emergency on any given timestep. Once the flight is created, it is added to an approach queue, which is a priority queue sorting flights based on their distance from the airport. Once the flight has reached the airport, it is appended to the ready to land priority queue, where flights with emergencies will be prioritized. Finally, if a runway is open it will be assigned to one, where it will eventually clear. This information is all displayed on the screen which refreshes every timestep.
